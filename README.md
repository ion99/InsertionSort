# InsertionSort

Insertion sort is a step more complex but a bit more useful than bubble sort. It's a sorting algorithm and is occasionally useful. The worst case scenario for it is similar to bubble sort's but its best case makes it suited for times when you're pretty sure a list almost sorted or likely already sorted.
The idea here is that the beginning of your list is sorted and the everything else is assumed to be an unsorted mess. The outer loop goes over the whole list, the index of which signifies where the "sorted" part of the list is. The inner loop goes over the sorted part of the list and inserts it into the correct position in the array.
